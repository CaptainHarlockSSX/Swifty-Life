# Swifty Life: A Swift implementation of Conway's Game of Life

Swift Package providing the logic of [Conway's simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

## 🎯 Goal

Implement logic of Conway's life simulation. Use this package with your favorite UI (on iOS, macOS etc...). 

> Note: I made this project to learn deeper Swift language, Apple ecosystem apps architecture, as well as Xcode features.
Any feedback or advise would be really appreciated.

Read the documentation to integrate this package within your app.
